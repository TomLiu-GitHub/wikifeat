Wikifeat   
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rhinoman/wikifeat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rhinoman/wikifeat)

### Introduction
Wikifeat is an open source collaboration platform built around the ever-popular [Wiki](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) concept.  It is meant to be extensible and highly usable.  Many enterprise collaboration platforms may be powerful and extensible, but they are often difficult to develop for and have an unfriendly, overly complicated user experience.

### Goals

The overarching goals for the Wikifeat project are:

- **Usability** - The core Wikifeat system should provide a simple, intuitive wiki experience with a
clean UI an a simple, easy to learn markup language (i.e., markdown).
- **Extensibility** - It should be possible to extend Wikifeat with additional services and front-end
plugins to provide new functionality and integrate Wikifeat with other systems.
- **Scalability** - It should be possible to horizontally scale a Wikifeat installation without great
difficulty.
 
### Screenshots

Here's a screenshot demonstrating the Wikifeat interface as well as a plugin embedded in a wiki page (in this case, an OpenLayers map):

Wiki pages are edited using simple Markdown -- specifically, [Commonmark](http://commonmark.org/).  A screenshot of the editor interface is shown here:

### Status

Wikifeat is currently under heavy development and should be considered alpha quality software (i.e., not suitable for production).
