About Wikifeat
==============

Wikifeat is an open source collaboration platform built around the ever-popular [Wiki](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) concept.

Wikifeat includes a number of features that make it more amenable to enterprise deployments, among them:

- Allows the creation of an arbitrary number of 'wikis', each with its own waccess controls and administrators.
- A microservices architecture that is easily scaled to accomodate more users.
- An extensible plugin architecture that enables the creation of new backend services as well as front-end functionality.
