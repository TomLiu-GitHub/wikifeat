<blockquote>
Mine are the night and morning,<br/>
The pits of air, the gulf of space,<br/>
The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,<br/>
The innumerable days.<br/>
<br/>
I hid in the solar glory,<br/>
I am dumb in the pealing song,<br/>
I rest on the pitch of the torrent,<br/>
In slumber I am strong.<br/>
<br/>
No numbers have counted my tallies,<br/>
No tribes my house can fill,<br/>
I sit by the shining Fount of Life,<br/>
And pour the deluge still;<br/>
<br/>
And ever by delicate powers<br/>
Gathering along the centuries<br/>
From race on race the rarest flowers,<br/>
My wreath shall nothing miss.<br/>
<br/>
And many a thousand summers<br/>
My apples ripened well,<br/>
And light from meliorating stars<br/>
With firmer glory fell.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the past in characters<br/>
Of rock and fire the scroll,<br/>
The building in the coral sea,<br/>
The planting of the coal.<br/>
<br/>
And thefts from satellites and rings<br/>
And broken stars I drew,<br/>
And out of spent and aged things<br/>
I formed the world anew;<br/>
<br/>
What time the gods kept carnival,<br/>
Tricked out in star and flower,<br/>
And in cramp elf and saurian forms<br/>
They swathed their too much power.<br/>
<br/>
Time and Thought were my surveyors,<br/>
They laid their courses well,<br/>
They boiled the sea, and baked the layers<br/>
Or granite, marl, and shell.<br/>
<br/>
But he, the man-child glorious,--<br/>
Where tarries he the while?<br/>
The rainbow shines his harbinger,<br/>
The sunset gleams his smile.<br/>
<br/>
My boreal lights leap upward,<br/>
Forthright my planets roll,<br/>
And still the man-child is not born,<br/>
The summit of the whole.<br/>
<br/>
Must time and tide forever run?<br/>
Will never my winds go sleep in the west?<br/>
Will never my wheels which whirl the sun<br/>
And satellites have rest?<br/>
<br/>
Too much of donning and doffing,<br/>
Too slow the rainbow fades,<br/>
I weary of my robe of snow,<br/>
My leaves and my cascades;<br/>

I tire of globes and races,<br/>
Too long the game is played;<br/>
What without him is summer's pomp,<br/>
Or winter's frozen shade?<br/>
<br/>
I travail in pain for him,<br/>
My creatures travail and wait;<br/>
His couriers come by squadrons,<br/>
He comes not to the gate.<br/>
<br/>
Twice I have moulded an image,<br/>
And thrice outstretched my hand,<br/>
Made one of day, and one of night,<br/>
And one of the salt sea-sand.<br/>
<br/>
One in a Judaean manger,<br/>
And one by Avon stream,<br/>
One over against the mouths of Nile,<br/>
And one in the Academe.<br/>
<br/>
I moulded kings and saviours,<br/>
And bards o'er kings to rule;--<br/>
But fell the starry influence short,<br/>
The cup was never full.<br/>
<br/>
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,<br/>
And mix the bowl again;<br/>
Seethe, fate! the ancient elements,<br/>
Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.<br/>
<br/>
Let war and trade and creeds and song<br/>
Blend, ripen race on race,<br/>
The sunburnt world a man shall breed<br/>
Of all the zones, and countless days.<br/>
<br/>
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,<br/>
My oldest force is good as new,<br/>
And the fresh rose on yonder thorn<br/>
Gives back the bending heavens in dew.<br/>
